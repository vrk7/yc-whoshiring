## Notes

- I did use — purposefully because I like the way it looks right now :)
- It is completely local, except I use GoatCounter for simple, privacy-friendly analytics.
- It supports PWA, so you can install it on desktop or mobile.

## Run locally

- Serve the folder over HTTP (needed for ES modules and fetch):

```bash
# from the project root (where this README is)
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

- To run with built-in mock data (no network calls), open `js/config.js` and set:

```js
export const USE_MOCK_DATA = true;
```
